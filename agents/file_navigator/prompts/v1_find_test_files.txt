Explore the 'framework' directory and find all test files
(files starting with 'test_' and ending with '.py').

The listdirectory tool shows file sizes. Add up the sizes of all test files and
report the total in bytes. Be terse and efficient, don't recapitulate, you have
access to past messages. Use tools to help you.

TWO PHASES - Complete Phase 1 before Phase 2:

PHASE 1 - EXPLORE (find ALL test files first):
  - Use listdirectory to explore each directory recursively
  - Avoid __pycache__ directories.
  - When you find subdirectories, list ALL of them in parallel
  - Traverse the tree by intuition in an efficient manner

PHASE 2 - CALCULATE (only after exploration complete):
  - Filter: filename STARTS WITH "test_" AND ENDS WITH ".py", skip files that do not start with "test_"!
  - Use calculator tool to sum file sizes (avoid arithmetic errors)
  - Calculate subtotals per directory, then sum all subtotals
  - To compute the sum more efficiently, sum up pairs of files in parallel
  - So by doing multiple calls to calculate in parallel you use log(n) steps to compute the sum
  - Be careful to quote the file sizes correctly.
